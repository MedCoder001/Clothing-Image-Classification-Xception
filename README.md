# Clothing Image Classification with Xception

This is a deep learning project that utilizes the Xception model to classify images of clothing items into different categories. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust clothing image classifier capable of recognizing various types of apparel, such as dresses, hats, long sleeves, outwear, pants, shirts, shoes, shorts, skirts, and t-shirts.

## Features

- Utilizes the Xception pre-trained model for feature extraction
- Fine-tuned for clothing image classification
- Customizable model architecture (size_inner, droprate)
- Data augmentation for improved model generalization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Getting Started

To clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MedCoder001/Clothing-Image-Classification-Xception.git
   cd Clothing-Image-Classification-Xception

## Model Checkpoints

Model checkpoints are saved during training in the `checkpoints/` directory. You can use these checkpoints to load pre-trained models or continue training.
